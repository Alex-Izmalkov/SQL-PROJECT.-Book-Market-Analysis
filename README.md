# SQL-PROJECT. Book-Market-Analysis

This is an SQL part of my final project during my studies at Practicum100

The project deals with an analysis of the book market during the times of coronavirus.

The task includes:
* Finding the number of books released after January 1, 2000.
* Finding the number of user reviews and the average rating for each book.
* Identifying the publisher that has released the greatest number of books with more than 50 pages (this will help you exclude brochures and similar publications from your analysis).
* Identifying the author with the highest average book rating (look only at books with at least 50 ratings).
* Finding the average number of text reviews among users who rated more than 50 books.
